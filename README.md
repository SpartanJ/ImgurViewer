**ImgurViewer**
===========

**ImgurViewer** is a little image viewer to open image links from external applications in the fastest way possible.

As the name suggests it was originally designed to open Imgur image links, but the application evolved to support some other images services too, the current image services supported are:

**Imgur**: with full support ( galleries, albums, gif videos, simple image links ). Gif links will be opened as videos to save bandwidth and faster loading.

**Gyazo**: full image support.

**Gfycat**: full Gfycat videos. As Imgur, it will load videos instead of gifs when possible.

**i.reddituploads.com** support.

**streamable.com** support.

**twitch clips** support.

**Instagram** image, video, and simple profile image gallery support.

**vid.me** support.

**flickr** support.

**GIPHY** support.

Also, **ImgurViewer** can open any link with a path with an image extension, so, it will try to handle any image link.

**ImgurViewer** as a standalone application doesn't do anything, so don't expect anything when opening the application.
It must be used in conjunction with some other external application as a web browser, reddit is fun, newsblur.
It's was done for my personal use and uploaded to [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ensoft.imgurviewer) to share it with the world. I hope that someone find it useful too.
